Description: Extracts meta-features from datasets to support the design of recommendation systems 
  based on Meta-Learning. The meta-features, also called characterization measures, are able to 
  characterize the complexity of datasets and to provide estimates of algorithm performance. The 
  package contains not only the standard characterization measures, but also more recent 
  characterization measures. By making available a large set of meta-feature extraction functions, 
  this package allows a comprehensive data characterization, a deep data exploration and a large 
  number of Meta-Learning based data analysis. These concepts are described in the book:
